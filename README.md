Password Generator
I started by getting and example from different websites of their password generators. I then looked at a fews tutorial of password generators using html. 
For my password generator I started with jumbotron in bootstrap.  I then added the second button so that I could use it for the copy to clipboard.

Included are two images of my assignment. One of my site when you first log onto it. The second is the result after a password is generated.
